Difficulties:
    - Learned the hard way, POSIX semaphores do not gurantee FIFO behaviour
    - Learned the use of "extern" keyword to define global varibales accross
        compile units (object files)
    - Avoid multiple header includes with header guards

Realized from desgin:
    - No busy waiting for syncornization events
    - synchronized access to the waiting queue
    - synchronized access to the parking
    - The stats varibles were shared and synchronized between the muliple threads


Failed to realize:
    - out-valets should be sleeping until cars are due.
        As mentioned in updated design, this method is not
        sound logically.
    - the intiall deaign failed to avoid the deadlock due to the wait for in-valet 
        to signal new parked cars but this is will cause a deadlock when the park is full. 
        This was solved in the updated design by changing the locking mechanism.


Build:
    "make" or "make all"
    to clear old build
    "make clean"

Comments:
    - Noticed low CPU utilization during runtime
    - There is a degree of concurrnacy in the simulation
        between the critical sections
