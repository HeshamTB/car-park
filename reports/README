Difficulties:
    - Learned the hard way, POSIX semaphores do not gurantee FIFO behaviour
    - Learned the use of "extern" keyword to define global varibales accross
        compile units (object files)
    - Avoid multiple header includes with header guards

Realized from desgin:
    - No busy waiting for syncornization events
    - 

Failed to realize:
    - out-valets should be sleeping until cars are due.
        As mentioned in updated design, this method is not
        sound logically.
    - 

Build:
    "make" or "make all"
    to clear old build
    "make clean"

Comments:
    - Noticed low CPU utilization during runtime
    - There is a degree of concurrnacy in the simulation
        between the critical sections
